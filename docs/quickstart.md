# ChromiumIDE quickstart (go/chromiumide-quickstart)

ChromiumIDE (formerly known as CrOS IDE) is a VSCode Extension for Chromium and
ChromiumOS development. We currently support only internal developers at Google.

See [go/chromiumide] for our internal landing page.

## Prerequisites (ChromiumOS)

For developing ChromiumOS, you need a ChromiumOS chroot. If you are a new member
and don't have it, please follow the [ChromiumOS Developer Guide] and set up
your development environment, so you can [enter the chroot via cros_sdk].

In this document, we assume ChromiumOS source code is in `~/chromiumos`.

## 1. Install Visual Studio Code

First, you need to install Visual Studio Code (VSCode) on your client machine.
Follow the instructions at [go/vscode/install].

[go/vscode/install]: http://go/vscode/install

### ChromeOS

ChromiumIDE supports only platform-specific VSCode, which is not available for
ChromeOS. There are two workarounds:

-   Check out [go/chromiumide-on-chromebooks] to learn more about [Code Server],
    which is a Web IDE accessible in the browser.
-   Use Chrome Remote Desktop.

## 2. (Optional) Connect to your machine via VSCode

If you use remote setup, for example gMac laptop, you will need
[Remote development] extension.

Install [Remote development] extension on the VSCode. Click the lower left "Open
a Remote Window" button and select \[Connect to Host...\] command (alternatively
directly choose this command from the command palette), select your remote
machine, and open your working directory under `~/chromiumos/`.

## 3. Install the extension

Open *View &rarr; Extensions* in VSCode (Ctrl+Shift+X), search [ChromiumIDE] and
install it.

## 4. Open a folder

Finally, open a folder with sources to let ChromiumIDE detect the chroot. Select
*File &rarr; Open Folder...*, choose, for example, `~/chromiumos/src/platform2`,
and you are good to go.

### [Code Completion and Navigation]

Code completion in C++ is available in platform2 packages which support
`USE=compdb_only`. Press F12 to [Go to Definition], Ctrl+F12 to Go to
Implementation, and so on.

### [Device Management]

ChromiumIDE provides a view to manage your test devices. With the built-in VNC
client, you can control a device remotely.

### [Linter Integration]

ChromiumIDE exposes lint errors found by `cros lint` and similar tools in C++,
Python, shell, and GN files. We run linters every time a file is saved, and mark
errors with squiggly lines in the editor and show them in the *Problems* box and
on mouse hover. This feature brings to your attention errors which block `repo
upload`.

### [Boards and Packages]

ChromiumIDE shows which packages you are working on and lets you run `cros_workon
start/stop` directly from the UI. Access it by clicking on *CrOS Development*
[activity bar] (Chrome icon). Use +/– buttons to start and stop working on packages.

### [Code Search]

You can easily open the current file in Code Search from the context menu in a
text editor. Go to [settings] to choose whether to chose which instance to use
(public, internal, or Gitiles).
